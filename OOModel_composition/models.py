    ##Â Note: The ObjectDescription approach was having SubObject and Release both inherits from the concrete ObjectDescription
    ##  It was decided it was too complicated to introduce polymorphism on this central model for the rare cases when it will be needed.
    ##  Just make a special hardcoded edge case "_subobject" to be set as the Release of an Instance that is logically a SubObject.
